Mental Health Analysis in the IT Sector

Overview

This project explores the application of machine learning to analyze and predict mental health conditions among individuals in the IT sector. Given the high-pressure environment, stress, anxiety, and other mental health challenges are prevalent. This analysis employs advanced machine learning techniques to identify trends and provide actionable insights to promote mental well-being.

Objectives

Predict mental health conditions using machine learning algorithms.

Analyze the impact of workplace factors like workload, anonymity, and treatment accessibility.

Provide insights into the effectiveness of mental health interventions.

Dataset

The dataset includes survey data collected from IT professionals with attributes such as:

Age: Age of respondents.

Gender: Gender of respondents.

Workload Intensity: Perceived workload levels.

Mental Health History: Previous history of mental health conditions.

Treatment Status: Whether treatment was sought or not.

Anonymity Status: Awareness of mental health status.

Tools and Technologies

Programming Language: Python

Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn

Visualization Tools: Power BI, Tableau

Machine Learning Models: Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, AdaBoost, Gradient Boosting, XGBoost

Methodology

Data Collection:

Gathered data from IT professionals via surveys and interviews.

Focused on mental health conditions like anxiety, stress, and depression.

Data Preprocessing:

Handled missing values, removed duplicates, and cleaned the dataset.

Normalized data for machine learning models.

Model Selection and Training:

Tested various machine learning algorithms, including Decision Tree, Random Forest, AdaBoost, and XGBoost.

Evaluated models using performance metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

Visualization:

Created graphs to understand correlations between attributes like treatment status and anonymity.

Visualized performance metrics and ROC curves for selected models.

Performance Evaluation:

Random Forest and AdaBoost emerged as top-performing models with accuracy scores of 85% and 86.9%, respectively.

Confusion Matrix and ROC curves were used to evaluate model effectiveness.

Key Findings

AdaBoost demonstrated the highest accuracy (86.9%) in predicting mental health conditions.

High workload intensity and lack of anonymity awareness strongly correlate with untreated mental health issues.

Visualizations revealed disparities in treatment-seeking behavior based on workplace factors.

Recommendations

Workplace Interventions:

Reduce workload intensity through resource allocation.

Encourage open discussions about mental health to reduce stigma.

Mental Health Support:

Provide accessible counseling services and mental health programs.

Training Programs:

Train managers to identify and address mental health challenges in teams.

Awareness Campaigns:

Raise awareness about the importance of mental health treatment.
